        company: "Tarot Over Coffee",
        testimonial: "I want to have an online business\" or \"I will pick content creation over a 9-5 anyday!\" We have all been there, right? Honestly, when I had started my Tarot business 5 years ago, I had underestimated how difficult it is to reach people. I thought quality service would be enough to attract potential clients- until reality kicked in. I realized, staying relevant is the key to any successful business. But how do I get started? This is when I found Renoweb. It has helped me set realistic goals and debriefed me about the process of executing them. Renoweb's curriculum had given me enough value to finally initiate. It explained the nuances of algorithms, helped me understand my audience better, and guided me to create a worksheet that works for my business. I'm truly grateful for the support I had received when I was lost."

        testimonial: "Learning from Gourab has been an amazing experience. He has a very unique way of simplifying linkedin's algorithm and helping you understand how things actually work behind the scenes. What I liked most is that he doesn't just give theory, he guides you step-by-step, checks your progress, and helps you improve your content in a practical way. His constant support and honest feedback made a huge difference for me. Gourab is genuinely one of the most helpful mentors I've come across. He explains things in such a simple way that LinkedIn suddenly starts making sense. His support and clarity really helped me improve how I write and show up on the platform. It's rare to find someone who's not just knowledgeable but also genuinely invested in helping you grow. I'm really grateful for his mentorship if you ever get a chance to learn from him, don't think twice!"

        testimonial: "I've tried learning LinkedIn strategy and content writing from many experts and even attended multiple workshops. But the kind of clarity and personal guidance I got from Gourab, the founder of Renoweb, was on another level. He didn't just teach the algorithm, he made me understand how LinkedIn actually works. More importantly, he showed me how to write content that truly connects with people. What I really appreciate is how hands-on and supportive he is throughout the process. It never felt like a one-way class, it felt like someone genuinely wanted me to grow. Honestly, if you're trying to understand LinkedIn the right way, Gourab is the person you should learn from. He's amazing at what he does."

        testimonial: "This is Suman, Founder of Bhromon Bilasi Tours & Travel, specializing in adventure travel. Before working with Renoweb, we struggled to generate quality leads online, as most of our bookings came through offline marketing and referrals. The Renoweb team completely revamped our online marketing strategy - from refining our brand messaging to creating the right content for our campaigns. Once we launched, we began consistently receiving 40-50 high-quality leads per day, and about 90% of them were genuinely interested or responsive, which was a huge \"aha\" moment for us. With their help, we've achieved 2x revenue growth while spending the same amount on ads. Truly impressive results!"
